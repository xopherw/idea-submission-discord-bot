# Idea Submission Discord Bot

This Discord Bot will generate embedded message when called and input is given.

I created this to help my Flutter coders server where we can submit our app idea with description to a channel and have every member vote on it

To submit your App Idea and writing Descriptions using the bot command, you must do it command below:

`$idea "my app idea" "This app will bring you fortune!"` NOTE: It has to be double quoted or else it would read the string differently

The bot will return an embedded message, with username on whoever called it, the message is shown below:

You are free to use it for any kind of embedded messaging bot in your discord channel! 

Hope you enjoyed it!
